# TrumpSentimentAnalysis
Based on a spring 2020 lesson from the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate Program, the R script executes a sentiment analysis of Donald J. Trump's tweets through all of 2020 and early 2021. Included are three select visualizations of log-odds ratios for different sentiments before and after three major historic events -- the WHO's COVID-19 pandemic declaration, the death of George Floyd, and Election Day 2020. Included is the CSV containing the analyzed tweets, which is downloadable through https://www.thetrumparchive.com/

Trump's tweets were significantly most likely to convey disgust and negativity before the pandemic declaration and, to a lesser extent, joy and anticipation afterward. After George Floyd's death, they were also less likely to convey disgust but more likely to convey fear, anger, joy, surprise, anticipation, and sadness. After Election Day, they were less likely to convey joy and much more likely to convey anger and negativity. Further research should examine more historical events from the time period and work to disentangle their influence in overlapping time periods.
